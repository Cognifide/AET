#### W3C HTML5 Issues Filter

W3C HTML5 Issues Filter allows to exclude some W3C HTML5 issues from result. Excluded issues will appear at the bottom of issues table and won't be taken into account when calculating status.

Name: **w3c-filter**

Resource name: source

Comparators: **w3c-html5**

### Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description | Mandatory |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- | --------- |
| `message` | string | Prefix or all message text of issue to be filter out. *see notes below | At least one of params should be used and all of used params should be not empty. |
| `messagePattern` | regexp | Regular expression that matches message text of issue to be filter out. *see notes below | At least one of params should be used and all of used params should be not empty. |

| `column` | integer | Column in source file where issue appear | |
*Note: 
- 'message' will be overridden by 'messagePattern' if set.
- there is an issue with some characters encoding in messages that comes from w3c-html5 output,
e.g. for message 
```` 'Bad value “Cache-Control” for attribute “http-equiv” on element “meta”.' ````
change '“' and '”' into '.{7}' (or '.+'); see example below so it would look like:
```` 'Bad value .{7}Cache-Control.{7} for attribute .{7}http-equiv.{7} on element .{7}meta.{7}.' ````
