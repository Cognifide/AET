## AET Suite Migration to AET 2.0
### Preparing the XML suite
You should perform the following changes in your project suite XML:

* remove the `environment="win7-ff16` property from the `suite` tag,

* remove the whole `<reports>` selection from XML,

| ! Important information |
|:----------------------- |
|Starting from this AET version, html reports are no longer generated as static files but are served by the dynamic web application. If you still need a xunit report please update your aet run command with the parameter `xUnit=true`. For more information refer to the [[Client Application|ClientApplication]] section. |

  
* check your `screen` collector definition, remove deprecated parameters: `maximize`, `width`, `height` (see  the [[Screen Collector|ScreenColector]] documentation for recommended changes),

* stop using the `w3c` comparator, use `w3c-html5` instead,

* [OPTIONAL] in `w3c-html5` use the `ignore-warnings` parameter instead of the `errors-only`parameter in `w3c-html5`.
